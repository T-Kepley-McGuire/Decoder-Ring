# Decoder-Ring

## A Thinkful Capstone Assignemnt

The content in this repository is meant to accompany the decoder ring capstone project for Thinkful

Decoder Ring is a website that can encode and decode messages according to three common cyphers:
* Caesar Cypher
* Polybius Cypher
* Substitution Cypher

## Implimentation

This app is built on the framework provided by Thinkful. All HTML and styling is Thinkful's original work

The scripts that are responsible for the work of encoding and decoding take any string and run it through the given cypher and return the encrypted message.

Reversing an encrypted message is done the same way

## Installation
