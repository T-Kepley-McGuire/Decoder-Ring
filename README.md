# Decoder-Ring
## My repository for the second Thinkful capstone project
The content in this repository is meant to accompany the decoder ring capstone project for thinkful.

Decoder Ring is a website that can encode and decode messages according to three common cyphers:
* Caesar Cypher
* Polybius Cypher
* Substitution Cypher
